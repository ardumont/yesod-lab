yesod-lab
=========

Learning yesod through experiences.

# Goal

Learning to create an API with [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/).

As always, I will reference every reproducible step in the Makefile.

# Init

This will install the needed dependencies (haskell-platform, mysql lib, etc...).
You also need the access to create the database.

``` sh
make init
```
